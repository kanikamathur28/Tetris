    <h2>The Matrix</h2>
    <p>Tetris is played on a 10 by 20 grid called theMatrix. Shapes called Tetriminos fall from the top of the Matrix and come to rest at the bottom. Only one Tetrimino falls at a time. At first the Tetriminos fall rather slowly; as the game progresses they will fall faster and faster.</p>
    <br />
    <h2>Moving the Tetriminos</h2>
    <p>Using the arrow keys, you can adjust where and how the Tetriminos fall. By pressing the LEFT and RIGHT Arrow keys, you canslide the falling Tetrimino from side to side. You can’t slide a Tetrimino past the edge of the Matrix. By pressing the UP Arrow key, you can rotate the Tetrimino 90 degrees clockwise. You can move the Tetriminos even after they land at the bottom of the Matrix briefly. The Tetrimino will Lock Down as soon as you stop trying to move it. At that point, the next Tetrimino will begin to fall.</p>
    <br />
    <h2>Hard Drop and Soft Drop</h2>
    <p>As your game improves and you begin to pay attention to the Tetriminos in your Next Queue, you might find yourself getting a little impatient waiting for the piece to fall. You have two options to speed up the game—the Soft Drop and the Hard Drop—and they’re both really easy to do.</p>

<p>The Soft Drop is performed by pressing the DOWN Arrow key—the Tetrimino will fall much faster than usual while you hold down the key, but as soon as you let go the piece will resume its normal pace. You retain complete control over the piece while doing a Soft Drop.</p>

<p>The Hard Drop is much less forgiving—hit the Space Bar to cause the Tetrimino to fall straight down,forgoing any further opportunity to move it. The Hard Drop is great for timed games where your goal is to get pieces into position as quickly as possible. Pay attention to the Ghost Piece to help you see where the Tetrimino will fall, and don’t press the space bar until you’re ready!</p>
    
    <br />
    <h2>Clearing Lines</h2>
    <p>The primary way to score points in Tetris is toclear lines by manipulating the pieces so that they fill horizontal row within the Matrix. As the pieces fall, your goal is to move and spin them so that they line up evenly at the bottom of the Matrix. To clear a line, every square of the row has to be filled.</p>
    <br />
    <h2>Scoring</h2>
    <p>The scoring formula for the majority of Tetris products is built on the idea that more difficult line clears should be awarded more points. For example, a single line clear in Tetris Zone is worth 100 points, clearing two lines at once is worth 400 points, clearing three lines at once is worth 800 points and clearing four lines at once (known as a Tetris) is worth 1200.</p>
